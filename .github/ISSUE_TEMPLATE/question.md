Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Hope everything is going okay using World Wire. 
It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to
share a couple resources that you could use if you haven't tried them yet ðŸ™‚.

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- [https://github.com/GFTN/](https://github.com/GFTN/) for questions about the Design System
- Request to join the #worldwire Slack Channel
- Visit [next.worldwire.io/docs](next.worldwire.io/docs) for info breaking changes

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
details below!

**Question**  
<!-- Provide as much useful information as you can. Screen shots, FAQ, terminology. -->
