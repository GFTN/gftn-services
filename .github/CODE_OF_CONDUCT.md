## Carbon Code of Conduct \U0001F58B"

This is a place to ask questions, work through any challenges, and share ideas and best practices. The following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make the community easier and more enjoyable to use.

- **Be respectful & understanding.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

### General

Communication through any of World Wire channels (emails, Slack) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved.

If you are subjected to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report the incident [here](https://w3-03.ibm.com/hr/global/concerns_and_appeals/index.jsp).

If you have suggestions to improve this Code of Conduct, please submit an issue or PR.

This Code of Conduct was adopted from the [Angular Project](https://github.com/angular/code-of-conduct/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Todo Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/).
