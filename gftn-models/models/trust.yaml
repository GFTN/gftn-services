      When the permission submitted by an OFI is "request", this is the identifier of the RFI who issued the asset. However, when the permission submitted by an RFI is "allow", this is the OFI's identifier (i.e., uk.yourbankintheUK.payments.ibm.com). Make sure you request trust first to the RFI's issuing account, and then also their operating account.
