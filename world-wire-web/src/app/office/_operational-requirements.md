1) Use email inbox API to capture every message sent to the customer and intercepted and received by the customer (perhaps create and integration that also sends the message to slack), 
see Microsoft Outlook API:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started 
see Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/
Need to determine which inbox API is best - gmail or outlook
