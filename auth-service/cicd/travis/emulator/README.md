See the code comments at the top of the ./docker/Dockerfile regarding how to run the emulator locally.

NOTE: see travis-emulation.sh to test steps that should run in travis. Simply copy steps from your travis.yml here to see output results faster. You will need to push your changes to travis-emulation.sh to github since, like travis, the emulator pulls these changes from git to test.
